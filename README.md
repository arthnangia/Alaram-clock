# Alarm-clock

It is a basic alarm clock developed in python, not actually proper alarm clock but it is used as a timer.

Approach:

User enter the numbers of hours, minutes or seconds after which he should be prompted [with 5 beeps].
we cannot enter the time as in basic alarm clock, instead its about a timer i.e. duration.
